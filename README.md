# ➰JavaScript For-Loop Lab

A hands-on review to explore and visualize how **JavaScript `for` loops** work.  
This interactive activity includes several predefined examples and a **Playground** for building your own custom loops.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This lab uses **HTML** and **JavaScript** to demonstrate how counting loops behave with different start, end and step values.  
Each card on the page represents a unique loop pattern. When the **Run** button is clicked, results stream dynamically to the screen.  
Use this project to strengthen your understanding of iteration, loop conditions, and number filtering.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

- Understand how a `for` loop operates in JavaScript.
- Practice counting **up** and **down** with custom step values.
- Apply filters to display only **odd**, **even** or **multiple-of-.** numbers.
- Update the **DOM** dynamically using JavaScript.
- Use form inputs to control program behavior.

---

## Requirements

- document.querySelector()
- insertAdjacentHTML() or append()
- for-loop

## 🃏 Features

### 🔹 Pre-Built Loop Examples

| Example | Start | End | Step | Filter |
|----------|--------|------|------|--------|
| Count Up 1 → 15 | 1 | 15 | +1 | None |
| Count Down 15 → 1 | 15 | 1 | -1 | None |
| Odd Numbers 1 → 30 | 1 | 30 | +1 | Odd only |
| Multiples of 5 (30 → 0) | 30 | 0 | -5 | Multiples of 5 |
| Full Range -50 → 50 | -50 | 50 | +5 | None |
| Multiples of 2 (-50 → 50) | -50 | 50 | +2 | Even only |

Each card includes:
- **Run** → Executes the corresponding loop and displays results.  
- **Reset** → Clears the display output.

### 🔧 Playground: Build Your Own Loop

Experiment with your own loop settings!  
You can adjust:
- **Start** value  
- **End** value  
- **Step** value  
- **Filter** (None, Odd, Even, Multiples of 5)

Buttons:
- **Run** → Generates and displays results in real time.  
- **Reset** → Clears the result display.
